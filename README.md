# Misc
Code test for [employer].

**Requirements:**
Using Spring and Java, develop a simple data entry application.

This application should have a single form with inputs for:

·        Name

·        Age

·        Title

·        Hometown

The form should also have a single submit button.

Name and Title should be required fields, while the others are not. The system should display an error message if the required fields aren’t entered.

When the submit button is pressed, the application should take you to a confirmation page that has all of the information that was entered, as well as a table of previous entries. 

This does not need to look pretty, but may put some CSS styling on the page to make it look somewhat presentable.
